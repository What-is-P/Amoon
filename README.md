# Amoon (formerly Xsinq)

Amoon is software designed for everything computers can do.

It is open source, because it has no license.

It has low system requirements so old computers and potatos can run it.

It doesn't require latest versions of services (to make more computers run it).

And it's made with GitHub (so anyone can fork it).

# System requirements

- **144MB** of storage (or higher)
- **2MB** of VRAM (or higher)
- **128 bytes** of RAM (or higher)
- **9 bytes** of external storage (or higher)
- At least **1** FPS (or higher)
- **1** Core (or higher)
- **1** pixel of monitor resolution (or higher)
- and finally, the ability to handle a **single** byte.

**Note**: amoon can run without external storage, this is due to the fact that it sacrifices and forces your computer that has to do everything it needs.
