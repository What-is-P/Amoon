# Amoon (formerly Xsinq)

Amoon is software designed for everything computers can do.

It is open source, because it has no license.

It has low system requirements so old computers and potatos can run it.

It doesn't require latest versions of services (to make more computers run it).

And it's made with GitHub (so anyone can fork it).
